It's very good that I can build my personal website here, but it's too hard to build a website in China. There are too many regulations. OK, I will record my thoughts. Although no one is watching, I will take my time. As some people say, as long as I can write it down, the problem will be solved in half.

とても良いです。ここで私の個人サイトを作ることができます。中国でウェブサイトを作るのは本当に難しいです。監督が多すぎます。いいです。私は私の考えを記録します。誰も見ていませんが、ゆっくりします。ある人が言っているように、書きさえすれば、問題は半分解決します。

Today I finally went to the hospital to have my molar removed because it was broken. Originally, I had root canal treatment in the hospital before, and I needed to make porcelain teeth in two weeks. Because I was lazy and my teeth didn't hurt any more, I didn't do it. As a result, my teeth were broken and I couldn't make porcelain teeth any more, so I had to pull them out and implant it. It was a big lesson for me that I shouldn't have put it off until it was too late to regret it and the teeth was eventually pulled out.
