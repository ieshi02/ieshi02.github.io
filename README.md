It's very good that I can build my personal website here, but it's too hard to build a website in China. There are too many regulations. OK, I will record my thoughts. Although no one is watching, I will take my time. As some people say, as long as I can write it down, the problem will be solved in half.

とても良いです。ここで私の個人サイトを作ることができます。中国でウェブサイトを作るのは本当に難しいです。監督が多すぎます。いいです。私は私の考えを記録します。誰も見ていませんが、ゆっくりします。ある人が言っているように、書きさえすれば、問題は半分解決します。

Today I finally went to the hospital to have my molar removed because it was broken. Originally, I had root canal treatment in the hospital before, and I needed to make porcelain teeth in two weeks. Because I was lazy and my teeth didn't hurt any more, I didn't do it. As a result, my teeth were broken and I couldn't make porcelain teeth any more, so I had to pull them out and implant it. It was a big lesson for me that I shouldn't have put it off until it was too late to regret it and the teeth was eventually pulled out.

Taiwan elected Tsai ing Wen as its leader. Unfortunately, this leader will make Taiwan fall into war, because China will not allow its own land to be divided, just like the United States does not allow the independence of the south, such as the civil war.Mainland China seems to have known that the KMT will fail in the election, so its new aircraft carrier went through the Taiwan Strait recklessly, which is believed to stimulate the sensitive nerves of Chinese Taiwanese.

The main reason why the KMT lost this election was because of disunity, just as it lost its mainland power in 1949. At that time, the Communist Party won the hearts and minds of China and won a decisive victory in military affairs, which was inconceivable. After the establishment of the government of the people's Republic of China, the Communist Party of China has established a set of social system which is totally different from any other country. After decades of continuous improvement, the system has worked well. It is a new invention of mankind, just like gunpowder, compass and books.

Some people say that the Chinese government represents dictatorship, which is wrong. On the contrary, every Party member of the Communist Party of China can only be elected, and every policy needs complex research and full investigation of everyone's requirements before it can be put into trial operation in a small area. If it works, it will be promoted to the whole country, so as to ensure that every policy is feasible In short, it is a typical method of scientific experiment, which is written into the party constitution of the Communist Party of China. Therefore, Chinese political parties do not believe in God, but in the spirit of science.

Maybe in some people's eyes, not believing in God is evil, but it should be clear that there are not only gods, but also many other gods. The gods of every culture should respect each other, shouldn't they?
