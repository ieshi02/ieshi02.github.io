打算用github做一个个人网页，不过发现这个网站不是那么容易使用，很多地方需要探索，连最基本的上传图片都还不会。

也不知道是怎么回事，github上传图片即使50KB都上传不了，看来想发布一些东西也不是那么简单的事情，好在发布文字还是不错的，不过汉字始终不是被那么多的人所认识，汉字实在太复杂了，可能使用英文要更好一些。

Today I finally went to the hospital to have my molar removed because it was broken. Originally, I had root canal treatment in the hospital before, and I needed to make porcelain teeth in two weeks. Because I was lazy and my teeth didn't hurt any more, I didn't do it. As a result, my teeth were broken and I couldn't make porcelain teeth any more, so I had to pull them out and implant it. It was a big lesson for me that I shouldn't have put it off until it was too late to regret it and the teeth was eventually pulled out.
